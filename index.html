    <pre><h2>Hoblitzelle Foundation</h2>
    Hoblitzelle Foundation was established by Karl and Esther Hoblitzelle in 1942
        for charitable, scientific, literacy or educational purposes within the
           State of Texas.  Since inception, the Directors haveapprovedover
             3,000 grants,investing almost $230 millionin the social
              service, cultural,educational, and medical\
                 organizations in Texas.

        In addition to funding organizations that are of value to the Dallas community and Karl Hoblitzelle,
            we also make an effort to fund projects that telescope time. In his will, Mr.Hoblitzelle
              stated:  "A foundation may bring or help bring into being a project or program of
                great promise and worth which might fail or be long deferred because of lack
                 of financial support from other sources.  I think this approach offers greater
                  opportunities to the foundation to be useful than to making of contributions
                     or recurring gifts to programs which have already been activated.”

        During Mr. Hoblitzelle’s lifetime, the Foundation focused on agronomy, medical research and teaching,
        community affairs, and education.  Support was provided to both war bond and troop
        entertainment programs during World Wars I and II.  In addition to serving on many Dallas
        and State of Texas boards and commissions, Karl Hoblitzelle was co-founder of the Southwestern
        Legal Foundation and Southwestern Medical School, which later became The University of Texas
         Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.  Support was provided to the Texas “School of the Air” when
          radio was the newest means of providing broader educational opportunities to rural areas.
           The Hoblitzelle's also built a significant collection of 18th Century English sterling silver
            that was donated to the Dallas Museum of Art.

        For more information about the history of Hoblitzelle Foundation, please refer to the book
        published by Paul W. Harris, President and CEO from 1986-2017:</pre>
