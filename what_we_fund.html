    <h2>What We Fund</h2>
    <pre class="wwf">The Foundation supports capital projects (i.e., building construction, acquisition, renovation,
        equipment, vehicles, and technology) of nonprofit organizations in Texas, primarily in the Dallas
        area.  When grants are made outside of this geographic preference, it is likely due to a historical
        interest exhibited by the founder, a current interest by a board member, or the large scope of impact
        the grant would have on that particular region of Texas.



        Under present policy of the Board of Directors, grants are not made for debt retirement, endowments, media
        productions, operations, programs, research, scholarships.   A few grants in these categories have
        been made, but they are infrequent and initiated by the Foundation.  Grants are typically not made to
        an organization more than once every three to four years.</pre>
